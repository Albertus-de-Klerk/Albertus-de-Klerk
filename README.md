Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Industrial Engineer with a strong focus on optimisation and mathematical modelling. My passion lies in applying analytical problem-solving techniques to fields such as motorsport racing and aerodynamics.

🔭 Current Work

I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree, where I am developing a mathematical model to assist in the design optimisation of airfoils for sailplanes, taking into account varying weather conditions. This project aligns with my passion for aerodynamics and performance engineering.

🌱 Currently Learning

Rust Programming: Exploring systems programming through the Rust Handbook and the Let’s Get Rusty developer course.

Advanced Optimisation Techniques: Further enhancing my expertise in mathematical modelling and data-driven decision-making.

🏎️ Interests

Formula One Racing: My love for F1 inspired my journey into optimisation. The sport’s complexity, engineering brilliance, and competitive nature align with my problem-solving mindset.

Fitness & Training: I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between physical fitness and intellectual growth. Team sports help me develop discipline, leadership, and communication skills.
