<h1>Hi there! 👋</h1>

<p>Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a <strong>Masters Student</strong> and <strong>Industrial Engineer</strong> with a strong focus on <strong>optimisation</strong> and <strong>mathematical modelling</strong>. My passion lies in applying analytical problem-solving techniques to fields such as <strong>motorsport racing</strong> and <strong>aerodynamics</strong>.</p>

<h2>🔭 Current Work</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing my <strong>Master’s degree</strong>, where I am developing a <strong>mathematical model</strong> to assist in the <strong>design optimisation of airfoils for sailplanes</strong>, taking into account varying <strong>weather conditions</strong>. This project aligns with my passion for <strong>aerodynamics and performance engineering</strong>.</p>

<h2>🌱 Currently Learning</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rust Programming</strong>: Exploring systems programming through the <strong>Rust Handbook</strong> and the <strong>Let’s Get Rusty</strong> developer course.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Optimisation Techniques</strong>: Further enhancing my expertise in mathematical modelling and data-driven decision-making.</li>
    <li><strong>Operations Research</strong>: As part of my Master’s degree, I am focusing on operations research, applying advanced optimisation methods to real-world problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🏎️ Interests</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Formula One Racing</strong>: My love for F1 inspired my journey into optimisation. The sport’s complexity, engineering brilliance, and competitive nature align with my problem-solving mindset.</li>
    <li><strong>Fitness & Training</strong>: I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between physical fitness and intellectual growth. Team sports help me develop discipline, leadership, and communication skills.</li>
</ul>
